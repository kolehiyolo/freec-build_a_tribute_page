## Overview
### Summary
The challenge doesn't really specify whether or not I should deviate from the design, but I chose not to alter anything at all to help polish my design observation skills. I find the content about Dr. Norman Borlaug to be truly fascinating and served as a powerful motivation for me.
### The Challenge
Users should be able to:
- See my submission to the project
- Perfectly mimic the sample page from [CodePen](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx)
- Make sure to follow the user stories dictated by freeCodeCamp
- Build it while ensuring accessibility and responsive-ness

## My Process
### Built With
- HTML5
- CSS5
- SASS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned
This project is where I really started getting into media-queries. It's been a while since I worked on this, but I remember dabbling with it for a while before really getting the desired results.

I also remember having problem with the responsive-ness of the main image as it wasn't properly adjusting as you reduce the width. This is where I also started using an [eye-dropper extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colorpick-eyedropper/ohcpnigalekghcmgcdcenkpelffpdolg) on Chrome to get all the right colors straight from the sample project.

I did not, at all, look at the code behind the CodePen project and based all the measurements on looks. I also took great care in finding the minute changes during breakpoints.

### Continued Development
Since this project, I've picked up the great habit of using the eyedropper tool for really getting the right colors. I've also become more acquainted to media-queries and how margins work.

### Useful Resources
- [ColorPick Eyedropper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colorpick-eyedropper/ohcpnigalekghcmgcdcenkpelffpdolg) - This helped me in getting exactly what colors to use.
